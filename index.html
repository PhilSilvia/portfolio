          <h2>Okay, but what have I done?</h2>
          <p>I graduated from the University of New Mexico in 2009 with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science.</p>
          <p>Since then I have pursued a variety of different roles over the next fifteen years.</p>
          <!-- List of experiences -->
          <ol>
            <li>I worked for a couple years as a systems analyst at a government contracting company.</li>
            <li>I was the owner and operator of a game store that sold tabletop card games, board games, and miniature games for about five years.</li>
            <li>I was a full-time homemaker on-and-off for a few years</li>
            <li>A shift supervisor at my local department store as well.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Having had many different roles and experiences I'm very excited to return to my roots as a programmer and developer. I have been working hard to catch up on new techniques and languages, to make sure I can combine a unique perspective and management skills with solid programming fundamentals.</p>
          <p>I offer a lot so if you are looking for a developer with a unique combination of new and old experience, I would love to work with you and your team to create novel programming solutions.</p>
